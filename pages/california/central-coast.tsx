            Along the California coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco are
            several resort towns well worth visiting. Between San Luis Obispo
            and San Francisco is the scenic coastal route of Highway 1, famous
            for its winding roads and bridges and stunning views overlooking the
            crashing waves below. These areas include Santa Barbara, Los Olivos,
            San Luis Obispo, Big Sur, Carmel, Pebble Beach and Monterey. It is
            fun to take a 3 or 4 day drive up the coast from Los Angeles and
            visit a couple of these quaint towns. You can stop by for lunch or
            dinner, or spend the night in one of the many lovely hotels. If you
            don't like driving there is an airport in a couple of the cities, as
            well as a passenger train that goes all the way up the coast. Check
            on-line or with your travel agent for travel-packages and discounts.

            A favorite weekend get-away for Angelinos is Santa Barbara. Less
            than a 2-hour drive from LA, this Spanish-influenced city, with its
            red-tile roofs and Spanish street names, is set right on the coast.
            Home to such celebrities as Oprah and Rob Lowe, this town is filled
            with high-end boutiques and world-class restaurants, yet maintains a
            small town feel. While you are there be sure and see the Mission
            Santa Barbara. Dubbed "The Queen of the Missions," this fabulous
            structure was founded in 1786 and is one of the best preserved
            missions in California. Within the Mission compound is a museum
            displaying its many historical Mexican artifacts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Situated in the center of town is State Street. It is filled with
            hundreds of lovely shops, restaurants, cafes and bars. It also has
            several large department stores. It's a great place to do a little
            eating and shopping, or stop for a coffee. Also on State Street is
            the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. It has a variety of arts, including
            works by Degas, Matisse, Picasso and Monet. At the very end of State
            Street is the beach and Sterns Wharf. Be sure to take a walk along
            the boardwalk or rent specialty bikes to take in the atmosphere. At
            Sterns Wharf you will find specialty shops, seafood restaurants and
            boat charters.
          </p>

          <p>
            Close to State Street you can find the Presidio de Santa Barbara
            Park and see El Cuartel, the second-oldest surviving structure in
            California, built in 1788. In the Downtown area there are many other
            Historic Adobes that you can walk by, including the County
            Courthouse on Anacapa Street. Another interesting sight is the Santa
            Barbara Zoo. With over 500 animals and a miniature train, this is a
            terrific place to take the kids for a couple of hours.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just about a 30-minute drive Northeast from Santa Barbara is the
            Santa Inez Valley. Here you will find the town of Los Olivos, now
            made infamous by Michael Jackson and his Neverland Estate. This
            scenic area is home to more than 60 wineries within a 15-mile
            radius. Many of them have tasting rooms and guided tours that you
            can take to see how wine is created from start to finish. We highly
            recommend taking a full day to tour the area and wineries, sampling
            the many various wines.
          </p>

          <p>
            Close to Los Olivos is the quaint Danish Town of Solvang, or "Sunny
            Field" in Danish. This beautiful little town was founded by a small
            group of Danish teachers in 1911. Known for its lovely shops,
            bakeries and windmills, Solvang is a wonderful place to stop for the
            afternoon on your way up the coast. Whether you like wine tasting,
            fine dining, water sports or golfing, the scenic Santa Barbara area
            and the Santa Ynez Valley has something for you.
          </p>

          <p>
            About midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco is the wonderful
            city of San Luis Obispo. The city was originally founded as a
            mission in 1772 and is also home to California Polytechnic State
            University (Cal Poly). While in San Luis Obispo, a trip to the
            Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolsa is a must. Located in the center of
            town, the mission is lovingly referred to as "The Prince of
            Missions." It is now a beautiful parish church. Inside, visitors can
            take a tour of the museum displaying Chumash Indian artifacts and
            belongings of early settlers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Along the coast, west of San Luis Obispo, is the quaint town of
            Baywood. It is a terrific place to spend the night and get a little
            rest and relaxation, such as at the Baywood Inn. From there you can
            also get a terrific view of the incredible Morro Bay Rock located in
            nearby Morro Bay. This enormous conical rock juts out of the ocean
            578 feet above the water. A walk around this incredible sight is a
            must. There is also a marina and fishing wharf close by. There you
            will find specialty shops, restaurants and fine-dining. You can also
            book a fishing tour or even rent kayaks.
          </p>

          <p>
            About 30 minutes Northwest of San Luis Obispo is the town of
            Cambria. This beautiful area is known for its stunning ocean views
            as well as its fine California wines. Cambria is part of the
            well-known scenic drive on Highway 1 between San Luis Obispo and San
            Francisco. On Main Street you will find wonderful shops and cafes.
            While you are there make sure to check out Nitt Witt on Hillcrest
            Drive, a 2.5 acre landmark property hand-built using such salvaged
            materials as driftwood and beer cans!
          </p>

          <p>
            Traveling north along the coast on HWY 1 you will then come to San
            Simeon. This area was made famous by William Randolph Hearst when he
            built his infamous 165-room Hearst's Castle there. Set aside a few
            hours to see this one-of-a-kind property. There are several
            different tours to choose from, depending on which part of the
            castle you would like to see. Make sure to plan on walking for about
            1 Â½ hours and going up and down plenty of stairs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Along the coast, just north of San Simeon is the scenic and majestic
            town of Big Sur. This is a wonderful place to spend the night and
            relax in one of its luxury hotel/spas. Be sure to go past the Point
            Sur Historic Park with its Point Sur Lighthouse.
          </p>

          <p>
            Continuing up the coast along HWY 1 you will come to an area called
            the Monterey Peninsula. During the 1800's this beautiful area was
            thriving due to its fishing and whaling industries. Cannery Row in
            Monterey was established in the 1920's for its sardine industry. Now
            the Monterey Peninsula, with its gorgeous natural beauty, has
            brought many visitors to the area and tourism is its top local
            industry. Visitors will find a dramatic coastline there with
            majestic cliffs, crashing waves, beautiful beaches, and incredible
            surfing. It is also a hot destination for golfers, especially in
            Pebble Beach, with its world-class golf courses. There is the famous
            "17-mile Drive" a private, scenic toll-road that travels from Carmel
            to Pacific Grove. It offers incredible views of the Pacific Ocean
            and its rugged coastline.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beginning on the southern tip of the peninsula is Carmel, or
            Carmel-by-the-Sea. This small town has a strong "village" atmosphere
            and no actual street addresses. Walking is the best way to get
            around. You can start with a stroll along the white sandy beach then
            head into town to see the many art galleries and interesting
            courtyards. Be sure and stop by the Carmel Mission. Established in
            1770, the Mission features a museum, lovely courtyard gardens and a
            Moorish bell tower.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just north of Carmel is Pebble Beach. You can travel part of the
            "17-Mile Drive" between these two coastal towns. Best known for its
            incredible golf courses, Pebble Beach has long been a golfer's
            paradise.
          </p>

          <p>
            From Carmel you can take the famous "17-mile Drive" to Pacific
            Grove. Originally a summer camp, Pacific Grove grew into a scenic
            and tranquil waterfront town. There are still more than 1200
            historic buildings in the area, including many well-preserved
            Victorian homes in the Downtown area. This is a great place to go
            hiking or biking, especially along the Monterey Peninsula
            Recreational Trail. Be sure to go by the Point Pinos Lighthouse on
            Asilomar Blvd which has been in operation since 1855.
          </p>

          <p>
            Continuing around the peninsula from Pacific Grove you will come to
            Monterey. This beautiful city is a wonderful place to stay. You can
            stroll through the shops, galleries and Restaurants of Cannery Row,
            formerly a sardine cannery. Be sure to go to the Monterey Bay
            Aquarium. It has over 700 species of marine life and, in our
            opinion, is one of the best aquariums in the country. Stop by the
            Fisherman's Wharf as well. For a little exercise, you can take the
            2-hour walking tour called the Monterey Path of History. There are
            many different types of lodging in Monterey, from a quaint
            bed-and-breakfast to a 4-star hotel. There are also several
            fine-dining restaurants to choose from.
